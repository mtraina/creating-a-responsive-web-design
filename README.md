Notes from the course https://www.udemy.com/creating-a-responsive-web-design/

### Margin and Padding
Every elements has a bounding box, this is how the browser sees that content.

**Margin**  
It is the space outside the bounding box.

**Padding**  
It controls the space inside the bounding box. When we add padding to the element we change the dimensions of the bounding box.

### Classes
You can assign only one id to an element, it has to be unique, but you can use several classes

```html
<div class="content trending"></div>
```

### SVG graphics
SVG stand for scalable vector graphics. Vectorial file format that can be scaled to any size on the browser.
